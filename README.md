Capture STDOUT and STDERR from Java with AutoCloseable

Synopsis
---

### Capturing

```java
import net.moznion.capture.output.stream.Capturer;

import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;

ByteArrayOutputStream stdout = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
ByteArrayOutputStream stderr = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

try (Capturer capturer = new Capturer(stdout, stderr)) {
    System.out.print("hello");   // <= don't print anything
    System.err.print("goodbye"); // <= don't print anything
} // turn back to original stdout and stderr at here

System.out.print(stdout.toString()); // <= print "hello" on stdout
System.err.print(stderr.toString()); // <= print "goodbye" on stderr
```

### Tee

```java
import net.moznion.capture.output.stream.Tee;

import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;

ByteArrayOutputStream stdoutBranch = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
ByteArrayOutputStream stderrBranch = new ByteArrayOutputStream();

try (Tee tee = new Tee(stdoutBranch, stderrBranch)) {
    System.out.print("hello");   // <= print "hello" and pass contents to stdoutBranch
    System.err.print("goodbye"); // <= print "goodbye" and pass contents to stderrBranch
} // don't pass contents to branch anymore if it reaches here

System.out.print(stdoutBranch.toString()); // <= print "hello" on stdout
System.err.print(stderrBranch.toString()); // <= print "goodbye" on stderr
```

Description
--

This package provides simple functions to capture or tee contents which is sent to STDERR or STDOUT.
It turns back to STDOUT or STDERR state which is before capturing or tee when escaping from try-with-resources statement.

This package is inspired by [Capture::Tiny](https://metacpan.org/pod/Capture::Tiny) from Perl.
